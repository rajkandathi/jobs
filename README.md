Jobs at Dash Labs
=================

There's nothing here right now.  You should change that.  

Fork this repository and do something which demonstrates your ability to perform the job to which you are applying.  Be succinct and have fun with it.  A large part of designing applications and programming computers is creativity.

Guidelines
----------

Do *not* submit an existing project.  Do something new.  It can include code you've worked on in the past (we all do that) but be original.

Be succinct.  Your submission could be as simple as a single method, a single `HTML` page or even a single screen mock-up.  Tailor your submission to the job for which you're submitting.  We assume you'll spend a couple of hours at most on your submission.  Because brevity is key, the little things do matter.  We'll be looking at comments, code organization, etc as much or even more intently as the visual or functional output of your submission.

Good luck and have fun!

**OnMyWay**

OnMyWay is an application built with some key attributes of Dash Labs mobile apps in mind i.e. Drive Safe, Drive Smarter. 

Idea: Often times, when I am driving to visit a family member/friend or when I have somebody visit me, I make/receive calls to check on status especially, how far are you? OnMyWay is an app developed to help drivers answer that question easily while concentrating on driving (rather than answering the phone).

The app is used to easily send a text message to other party (your contact) with information on how far are you.

Note: The app was developed and tested in iOS6, iPhone 4S.
